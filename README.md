## Career 

For most of the last year I have been working on Udacity's [Self Driving Car](https://www.udacity.com/course/self-driving-car-engineer-nanodegree--nd013) NanoDegree.  I decided to complete this journey after auditing the free [Artificial Intelligence for Robotics](https://www.udacity.com/course/artificial-intelligence-for-robotics--cs373) course and partway through completing Udacity's "Intro to Parallel Programming"* which is focussed on CUDA.  The SDC nanodegree intrigued me, as I had always been interested in autonomous control of vehicles.  I enrolled as soon as I could make time for it.  I graduated in April, and now I am interested in finding work in this field.

`* Although I can still access CS344, Udacity no longer offers this class.` 

Here are some links to projects I completed for the SDC nanodegree
