## Career 

For most of the last year I have been working on Udacity's [Self Driving Car](https://www.udacity.com/course/self-driving-car-engineer-nanodegree--nd013) NanoDegree.  I decided to complete this journey after auditing the free [Artificial Intelligence for Robotics](https://www.udacity.com/course/artificial-intelligence-for-robotics--cs373) course and partway through completeing Udacity's "Intro to Parallel Programming" which is focussed on CUDA.  The anouncement of the SDC nanodegree intrigued me, and I enrolled as soon as I could make time for it.
